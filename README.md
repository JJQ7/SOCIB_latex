# SOCIB template latex
LaTeX source files for posters and presentations, following examples provided in ppt.

The .tex files have to be compiled using [xelatex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX) in order to get the same font as in the ppt (_FF Cube_). 

The FF Cube font has to be installed (_Cube-Regular.ttf_ or _Cube-Regular2.otf_) in ~/.fonts directory.

## Presentation 

* _SOCIB_presentation.tex_ is the template for a presentation. This file contains a basic example.
* _beamerthemeSOCIB.sty_ is where all the configuration for the style is done.

## Poster

* _SOCIB_poster.tex_ is the template for a poster. The compilation will fail as the images are not provided with the code.
* _beamerthemeSOCIBposter.sty_ is where all the configuration for the style is done.
